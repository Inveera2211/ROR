After much consideration and analysis of the packaged applications available, I decided that I needed a custom solution for my web application. Rails Factory weren't the first company I worked with but they have been the best. They have worked with me to develop a solid and great performing application which delivers the custom features I needed to differentiate our product in the marketplace. The Rails Factory team has put in tremendous efforts to get our product live, and I am now using them for support and the next phase of development. I highly recommend them.”
